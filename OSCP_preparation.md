#Â OSCP preparation

## Advises

- Stick to the methodology.
- Keep notes of how you root the machines (even for the lab) and do the pentest report as you do the lab.
- Loot properly the machines (post-exploitation) to get some creds.
- The focus of the course is to use know exploits or know approaches to manual exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- Try harder
